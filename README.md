# Project Euler Solutions

![Project Euler Logo](https://github.com/pmentor/Project-Euler-Solutions/assets/101071780/7f363675-0548-4dd1-86b2-d2dc765398dc)


This repository contains my solutions to various problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require creative solutions and programming skills. Each problem comes with a specific set of rules and constraints, and the objective is to find the most efficient solution.

## About Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The problems range in difficulty and cover various areas of mathematics and computer science. It is an excellent platform for honing your problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding abilities.

**Note:** If you are actively working on Project Euler and want to challenge yourself without spoilers, I recommend not viewing the solutions until you have attempted the problems yourself.

## How to Use This Repository

Each problem's solution is organized into its own directory, named according to the problem's number. Within each directory, you'll find the following:

- `problemX.py`, `problemX.ipynb` or `problemX.cpp`: This is the main file containing the solution code written in Python (`.py`), Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) or C++ (`.cpp`) format.
- `input.txt` (if applicable): Some problems may require input data. This file contains the sample input used during the solution process.
- `output.txt` (if applicable): For problems with specific output requirements, this file contains the expected output based on the provided input.
- `README.md`: Some solutions have a README file with a brief explanation of the problem, the approach taken for solving it, and any relevant observations or optimizations.

## Getting Started

To use the solutions in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/pmentor/project-euler.git`.
2. Navigate to the specific problem directory you want to explore.
3. Open the `problemX.py`, `problemX.ipynb` or `problemX.cpp` file to see the solution code.
4. If the problem requires input data, ensure the `input.txt` file is available in the same directory.
5. Run the code to see the solution's output.

## Disclaimer

The purpose of this repository is to share solutions and promote learning and discussion. While sharing solutions is allowed, copying code directly from this repository and submitting it as your own to Project Euler or any other similar platform is discouraged and goes against the principles of independent learning and problem-solving.
